              Using all the data youâ€™ve collected, design a display for a museum
              exhibit highlighting the use of light, color, and spectra in
              analyzing artworks. Choose one of the works of art featured in
              this project to display in an exhibit. Develop a display that
              tells the story of the hidden details a visitor might not see from
              looking at the piece. Your display should include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                At least two regions of interest within your chosen painting.
              </li>
              <li>
                At least one spectrum or comparison image taken with the
                techniques described in this activity. (You may take screenshots
                from the online tool and paste them into your notebook.)
              </li>
              <li>
                A caption with a description describing how art conservationists
                might use the data presented.
              </li>
            </ul>
