00:07.230 --> 00:10.220
Having information about what pigments are in an object

00:10.230 --> 00:15.220
can help provide information about when and where that object might have been made.

00:17.230 --> 00:20.040
Materials respond differently to different wavelengths,

00:20.040 --> 00:24.090
if they reflect in the infrared, but absorb in the visible,

00:24.090 --> 00:27.220
those are going to give us information about what that pigment is.

00:29.230 --> 00:33.230
And so I&#039;m gonna use a filter that

00:33.230 --> 00:38.070
blocks visible light and passes infrared radiation.

00:38.070 --> 00:40.220
So we can&#039;t see through it because we can&#039;t see into the infrared.

00:43.220 --> 00:48.210
We&#039;re looking at a reflected infrared image of the pigment charts.

00:48.220 --> 00:53.210
We&#039;re going to see some different responses of those pigments.

00:53.210 --> 00:57.090
Let&#039;s take a look at some of those blues.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.210
So this is the infrared image, we&#039;re going to switch back to the visible

01:01.220 --> 01:04.210
We can see some differences in how

01:04.220 --> 01:07.210
the infrared wavelengths are being absorbed and reflected.

01:07.220 --> 01:10.210
So we see here, Prussian blue is absorbing

01:10.220 --> 01:12.210
that infrared radiation.

01:12.210 --> 01:18.120
This is Prussian blue, too, but we have azarite, which is not absorbing quite as much

01:18.120 --> 01:22.210
Indigo, it&#039;s reflecting quite a bit, so we are seeing those differences.

01:22.220 --> 01:25.210
And you can do some processing to really bring out those

01:25.210 --> 01:29.190
differences, and that&#039;s creating a combined image

01:29.190 --> 01:33.210
of the visible light and the infrared, and it&#039;s a false color infrared image.

01:33.210 --> 01:36.210
And that can give us some information about characterizing

01:36.210 --> 01:38.200
and differentiating those pigments.

01:40.210 --> 01:45.200
I&#039;m Matthew Clark, I&#039;m a conservation scientist at the National Museum of Asian Art.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.170
One of the tools that we use here is a

01:48.170 --> 01:52.200
hyper-spectral imaging camera that&#039;s going to split up light

01:52.200 --> 01:56.190
into the different wavelengths and measure that

01:56.190 --> 01:58.220
on the camera sensor.

01:58.220 --> 02:03.090
This particular camera is going to capture a line of light

02:03.090 --> 02:08.200
and it&#039;s going to spread that line of light across the chip of the camera.

02:08.200 --> 02:12.180
So we&#039;re going to have a spectrum from each section of that line.

02:12.180 --> 02:18.130
The camera then is going to move along the surface, and we&#039;ll keep collecting those

02:18.130 --> 02:21.190
lines that then can all be assembled into

02:21.190 --> 02:25.190
a cube of data later that we can examine and interpret,

02:25.200 --> 02:29.190
and use different specialized software to interpret the data.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.200
Right now, we&#039;re looking at a scene from the

02:32.200 --> 02:35.190
Japanese hand scrolls about Jizō Bosatsu

02:36.200 --> 02:40.190
And in this scene, we&#039;ve identified pigments

02:40.200 --> 02:43.190
that are present based off of the spectra that we see.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.190
And in this interior scene, we can see a

02:46.190 --> 02:50.180
number of ladies in waiting inside on

02:50.190 --> 02:53.180
these tatami mats, which appear as somewhat of green

02:53.180 --> 02:59.180
and we can see a number of areas of red and some other discoloration.

02:59.190 --> 03:01.180
This is a set of spectra.

03:01.180 --> 03:05.180
I&#039;m going to focus on this green spectrum, which is a copper green.

03:06.190 --> 03:08.180
And this purple spectrum that we

03:09.190 --> 03:11.180
can associate as indigo.

03:11.190 --> 03:14.180
So we&#039;re going to take these different spectra and

03:15.190 --> 03:19.180
process all the spectra within that data cube

03:19.190 --> 03:22.180
to look for when do we see these features.

03:22.190 --> 03:25.180
So if we were trying to, let&#039;s say, look for

03:25.190 --> 03:28.180
this copper green, if we know is

03:28.180 --> 03:31.170
present based on the appearance and based on other techniques where we know that there&#039;s copper

03:31.170 --> 03:37.170
present, we can---I have to open up another file to highlight this---

03:37.170 --> 03:41.170
So what we&#039;re seeing now is: Everywhere where it is bright,

03:41.170 --> 03:43.090
the whiter it is,

03:43.090 --> 03:48.170
the closer a match it is to that copper green spectrum.

03:49.180 --> 03:53.170
So in these areas where we can see these tatami mats, 

03:53.170 --> 03:56.170
we can see a really strong signal from that copper green,

03:56.180 --> 03:59.000
more so than we might expect

03:59.010 --> 04:01.170
based on looking at it visibly.

04:01.180 --> 04:04.170
The other case, the indigo that I mentioned, if I was

04:04.180 --> 04:08.170
glancing at this, I might not say, where is the indigo?

04:08.180 --> 04:13.170
So that, again, is this purple spectrum.

04:13.170 --> 04:17.160
It has this kind of particular inflection point around 7000 nanometers.

04:18.170 --> 04:21.170
And if I load that spectrum, where

04:21.170 --> 04:25.040
we see these bright white areas is where

04:25.040 --> 04:28.160
this indigo was present.

04:28.170 --> 04:31.160
So in that case, it&#039;s really found

04:31.170 --> 04:35.160
at the bottom of the scroll, giving sort of either a watery or

04:35.160 --> 04:38.160
foggy presence below this interior scene.

04:39.170 --> 04:42.170
And we&#039;ve actually found that in a lot of different areas of the scroll,

04:42.170 --> 04:45.160
with this indigo. Once we know it&#039;s there, you can kind of 

04:45.170 --> 04:50.160
just see its presence, but we can also see where it was lost between the fill.

04:50.170 --> 04:56.010
So this is going to be... The contrast is a bit boosted now to look at

04:56.010 --> 04:59.160
one of the things we&#039;d like to do is to confirm these

04:59.160 --> 05:02.040
areas where we think there is indigo, 

05:02.040 --> 05:05.200
based off of the statistical analysis.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.100
I want to actually confirm by looking at the spectrum there.

05:08.100 --> 05:12.160
So here, I can pull up the spectrum

05:12.160 --> 05:15.150
and see that kind of distinctive shape of the indigo.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.150
So that lets me know it&#039;s there.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.150
And in areas where, by my eye, it looks like a

05:19.150 --> 05:24.150
very similar faint blue in this area of damage.

05:24.160 --> 05:28.070
The software doesn&#039;t see the indigo, and I don&#039;t see it there in the spectrum either.

05:28.070 --> 05:31.170
So, we&#039;re able to pull out some of this information

05:31.170 --> 05:34.150
that we wouldn&#039;t otherwise note.

05:34.150 --> 05:37.200
And we can kind of essentially go

05:37.200 --> 05:41.040
and kind of explore around the scene.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.150
Here, we&#039;re looking at this deep red color, which is the vermilion,

05:45.150 --> 05:48.140
which is a mercury sulfide, and has a very sharp transition.

05:48.150 --> 05:50.140
It&#039;s very distinctive.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.140
The palette of this scroll compared to some of

05:53.150 --> 05:58.140
the other things that we look at is much more limited, and that it&#039;s supposed to simply be the style.

05:59.150 --> 06:04.140
Now, you too, can analyze historic artworks from our collection using advanced spectral imaging.
