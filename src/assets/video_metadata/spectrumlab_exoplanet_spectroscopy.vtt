00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.560
If you look at the solar system,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.150
we basically have eight planets

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.310
that everybody knows their names.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.190
And as you look at other stars around the Sun,

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.010
it turns out that pretty much every star has a planet,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.470
so we call those planets exoplanets,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.990
planets outside the solar system.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.050
The most successful way to discover exoplanets

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.690
is the transit method in which planets

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.390
go in front of the star and the light

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.350
coming from the star drops by about 1%

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.170
and that's how you know that there's a planet there.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.310
The transiting method is a very powerful method

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.330
because if we can get enough precision in the measurement

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.568
of that transit, you can actually answer questions like,

00:00:43.568 --> 00:00:46.230
"What are these planets made of?"

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.590
And the way we do this is the light

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.020
that we collect from that star

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.720
while the planet is going in front of it,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.690
we use things like prisms

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.900
and we split that light into different colors.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.820
So by looking at how the depth of the transit changes

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.760
as a function of color, we can detect the number

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.340
of chemical elements and molecules in the atmosphere

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.220
of the planet, such as sodium, potassium,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.040
water, and other molecules.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.300
Hot Jupiters are these very peculiar type of planet,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.810
which is they are about the same size of our own Jupiter,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.950
sometimes a little bit bigger,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.070
sometimes a little bit smaller, but around that size,

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.900
but the cool thing about these systems

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.640
is that they orbit very, very close to their host star.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.810
Like a typical hot Jupiter

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.690
goes around once every three days.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.910
There's nothing like this in the solar system.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.710
This is new science.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.020
The second good thing about hot Jupiters

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.650
is that they're very easy to observe.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.390
And I say that they're very easy now.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.210
30 years ago it was difficult, but now it's easy,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.000
so we can get very, very large signals

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.640
and we can measure very, very precisely

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.000
the properties of these planets.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.380
With this technique, we can observe molecules such as water

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.740
and elements such as potassium and sodium.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.080
So why sodium and potassium?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.740
You can learn a lot about how that planet was born

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.690
and how it became a hot Jupiter.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.690
That planet most likely started farther out in that system

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.430
and somehow it migrated in,

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.360
and as it migrated in, was collecting sodium and potassium

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.413
from dust grains on the disc where the planet formed.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.920
With the launch of the James Webb Telescope,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.010
we are now witnessing a revolution in this field.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.670
Some of these molecules that we can now observe

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.670
in the right environment could be signs of life

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.835
producing those molecules in this planet.

00:02:51.835 --> 00:02:55.380
This is what we call biosignatures or biomarkers.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.420
For example, if you look at Earth,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.510
we know that there are certain molecules on Earth

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.190
that are produced by life.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.720
We know that there is oxygen,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.460
we know that there is methane,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.740
and those molecules would not be stable

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.650
in Earth's atmosphere if there wasn't some kind

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.260
of organism producing them.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.640
And in addition to that,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.850
we will have to look at other properties of the planet.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.400
We will have to look at whether the planet

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.950
is rocky or not, i.e., the density.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.040
We will have to look at the temperature of the planet.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.160
We will have to look at the ultraviolet radiation

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.880
coming from the star to see if life can survive,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.520
so once we put all these pieces together,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.610
I do believe that we will find life somewhere.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.510
It's not gonna be easy, but I do believe that we'll do it.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.740
So now it's your turn to apply what you have learned

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.030
about spectroscopy to exoplanet atmospheric spectra

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.240
and propose what molecule or molecules

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.537
you want to search for in real JWST data.

00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:00.120
(upbeat music)
