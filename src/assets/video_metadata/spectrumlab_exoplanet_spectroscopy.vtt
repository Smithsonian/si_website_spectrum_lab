00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.520
If you look at the solar system,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.200
we basically have eight planets

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.360
that everybody knows their names.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.240
And as you look at other stars around the Sun,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.040
it turns out that pretty much every star has a planet,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.520
so we call those planets exoplanets,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.040
planets outside the solar system.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.080
The most successful way to discover exoplanets

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.720
is the transit method in which planets

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.440
go in front of the star and the light

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.400
coming from the star drops by about 1%

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.200
and that's how you know that there's a planet there.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.360
The transiting method is a very powerful method

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.360
because if we can get enough precision in the measurement

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.600
of that transit, you can actually answer questions like,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.280
"What are these planets made of?"

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.640
And the way we do this is the light

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.040
that we collect from that star

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.760
while the planet is going in front of it,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.720
we use things like prisms

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.920
and we split that light into different colors.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.840
So by looking at how the depth of the transit changes

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.800
as a function of color, we can detect the number

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.360
of chemical elements and molecules in the atmosphere

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.240
of the planet, such as sodium, potassium,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.080
water, and other molecules.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.320
Hot Jupiters are these very peculiar type of planet,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.840
which is they are about the same size of our own Jupiter,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.000
sometimes a little bit bigger,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.120
sometimes a little bit smaller, but around that size,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.920
but the cool thing about these systems

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.680
is that they orbit very, very close to their host star.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.840
Like a typical hot Jupiter

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.720
goes around once every three days.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.960
There's nothing like this in the solar system.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.760
This is new science.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.040
The second good thing about hot Jupiters

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.680
is that they're very easy to observe.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.440
And I say that they're very easy now.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.240
30 years ago it was difficult, but now it's easy,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.040
so we can get very, very large signals

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.680
and we can measure very, very precisely

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.040
the properties of these planets.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.400
With this technique, we can observe molecules such as water

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.760
and elements such as potassium and sodium.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.120
So why sodium and potassium?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.760
You can learn a lot about how that planet was born

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.720
and how it became a hot Jupiter.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.720
That planet most likely started farther out in that system

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.480
and somehow it migrated in,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.400
and as it migrated in, was collecting sodium and potassium

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.440
from dust grains on the disc where the planet formed.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.960
With the launch of the James Webb Telescope,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.040
we are now witnessing a revolution in this field.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.720
Some of these molecules that we can now observe

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.720
in the right environment could be signs of life

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.880
producing those molecules in this planet.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.400
This is what we call biosignatures or biomarkers.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.440
For example, if you look at Earth,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.560
we know that there are certain molecules on Earth

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.240
that are produced by life.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.760
We know that there is oxygen,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.480
we know that there is methane,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.760
and those molecules would not be stable

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.680
in Earth's atmosphere if there wasn't some kind

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.280
of organism producing them.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.680
And in addition to that,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.880
we will have to look at other properties of the planet.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.440
We will have to look at whether the planet

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.000
is rocky or not, i.e., the density.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.080
We will have to look at the temperature of the planet.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.200
We will have to look at the ultraviolet radiation

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.920
coming from the star to see if life can survive,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.560
so once we put all these pieces together,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.640
I do believe that we will find life somewhere.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.560
It's not gonna be easy, but I do believe that we'll do it.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.760
So now it's your turn to apply what you have learned

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.080
about spectroscopy to exoplanet atmospheric spectra

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.280
and propose what molecule or molecules

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.560
you want to search for in real JWST data.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.160
(upbeat music)
