00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.960
Infrared wavelengths

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.760
are longer than visible light.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.640
While infrared can't be detected by the human eye,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.760
differences in pigments are revealed when using a filter,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.760
one that blocks visible and ultraviolet wavelengths,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.320
passing only the infrared.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.400
So we're looking at a reflected infrared image

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.680
of the pigment charts.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.680
We're gonna see some different responses of those pigments.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.320
This is visible light, and then looking at infrared,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.000
those whites do not respond differently within the infrared,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.400
so we're not seeing a difference there.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.600
But let's take a look at some of those blues.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.160
So this the infrared image,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.800
we're gonna switch back to the visible.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.120
We can see some color differences in these.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.960
And then we're also seeing some differences

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.880
in how the infrared wavelengths

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.680
are being absorbed and reflected.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.320
So we see here Prussian blue is absorbing

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.840
that infrared radiation.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.560
This is Prussian blue too.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.320
But we have azurite, which is not absorbing quite as much.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.240
Indigo, it's reflecting quite a bit,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.360
so we are seeing those differences.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.000
And you can do some processing

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.080
to really bring out those differences

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.520
and that's creating a combined image

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.080
of the visible light and the infrared.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.200
And it's a false color infrared image.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.840
And so we're seeing those differences

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.440
in how the pigments are responding to the infrared

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.720
with a color difference here.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.720
So you see Prussian blue is turning this purpley blue,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.200
and then indigo is a bright red.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.960
And that can give us some information about characterizing

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.840
and differentiating those pigments.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.480
