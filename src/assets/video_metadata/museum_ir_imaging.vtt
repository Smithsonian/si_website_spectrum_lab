00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.110
<v Narrator>Infrared wavelengths</v>

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.910
are longer than visible light.

3
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.790
While infrared can't be detected by the human eye,

4
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.910
differences in pigments are revealed when using a filter,

5
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.910
one that blocks visible and ultraviolet wavelengths,

6
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.473
passing only the infrared.

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.550
<v ->So we're looking at a reflected infrared image</v>

8
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.860
of the pigment charts.

9
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.860
We're gonna see some different responses of those pigments.

10
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.480
This is visible light, and then looking at infrared,

11
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.150
those whites do not respond differently within the infrared,

12
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.580
so we're not seeing a difference there.

13
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.760
But let's take a look at some of those blues.

14
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.320
So this the infrared image,

15
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.960
we're gonna switch back to the visible.

16
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.290
We can see some color differences in these.

17
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.120
And then we're also seeing some differences

18
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.030
in how the infrared wavelengths

19
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.830
are being absorbed and reflected.

20
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.490
So we see here Prussian blue is absorbing

21
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.020
that infrared radiation.

22
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.730
This is Prussian blue too.

23
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.480
But we have azurite, which is not absorbing quite as much.

24
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.400
Indigo, it's reflecting quite a bit,

25
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.530
so we are seeing those differences.

26
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.180
And you can do some processing

27
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.250
to really bring out those differences

28
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.670
and that's creating a combined image

29
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.260
of the visible light and the infrared.

30
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.360
And it's a false color infrared image.

31
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.000
And so we're seeing those differences

32
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.610
in how the pigments are responding to the infrared

33
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.900
with a color difference here.

34
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.877
So you see Prussian blue is turning this purpley blue,

35
00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:29.370
and then indigo is a bright red.

36
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.120
And that can give us some information about characterizing

37
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.993
and differentiating those pigments.

38
00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:38.660
(bright music)
