00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.560
Hi, we're in the Smithsonian

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.240
American Art Museum's 19th century galleries.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.200
My name is Scott.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.120
I'm the lighting designer of this museum.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.800
My job is literally to make these artworks

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.560
look as good as they can.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.640
Is light visible?

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.480
It seems obvious.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.800
Yes, light is visible.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.480
But I can create the conditions as a lighting designer

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.280
so light appears invisible.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.400
For example, right in front of me,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.400
there's a giant bright beam of light.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.640
And you wouldn't know it until I put my hands in front of it

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.720
or my face in front of it, and then it becomes apparent.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.200
And that's so much of what my job is,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.640
is to literally put the light where I want it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.320
and take it away where we don't.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.000
And that's what I'm expert in.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.480
Well, I'm gonna press this button

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.120
and I'm going to transition this hallway

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.920
from kind of bright lighting to show you the magic that I do

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.320
when I take each individual spotlight

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.600
and I aim it very carefully at the artworks,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.800
and it looks like this.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.280
So, let's see, 1, 2, 3.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.920
Do you see that?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.600
That the artworks start coming up brighter and brighter.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.880
And literally, the painting starts coming forwards.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.320
You might be able to actually see the rainbow come out

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.280
in the the Niagara Falls,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.680
and it's really much more dramatic.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.400
This is the Alma Thomas Gallery

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.320
and one of my favorite paintings we have.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.080
This is Alma Thomas' "Snoopy."

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.000
She actually named it after the cartoon,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.640
but even more, the Lunar 10 Module was nicknamed "Snoopy,"

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.280
the module that would actually snoop around the Moon,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.040
looking for the perfect place to land.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.520
What is it about the light

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.040
that allows us to see this full range of color?

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.120
On this artwork, there's about three or four lights.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.280
They're all basically the same kind of light.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.760
It's what I call a blue-pump phosphor LED.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.800
You go to a hardware store or your grocery store,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.120
almost every single light bulb in there that isn't colored

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.280
that's putting out what you think of as white light

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.640
is a blue-pump phosphor LED.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.680
Blue-pump phosphor.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.520
What does that mean?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.520
That means that the LEDs that inside are actually blue.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.200
And then we take this yellow phosphor,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.640
we lay it on top of the blue and it explodes in white light.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.880
And it's exactly the same kind that we are using here.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.000
So we smashed a few light bulbs.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.440
Let me show you this one.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.960
So when we smashed this light bulb,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.040
it ended looking up like this.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.840
And you see these LEDs? Actually starts with a blue LED.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.880
The LED itself is blue.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.240
It's kind of unbelievable.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.280
And then this phosphor coating

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.200
will make it explode in white light.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.160
Don't take my word for it.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Let me show you.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.280
But first, I need to put on these goggles

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.600
because I'm gonna turn on some blue light,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.120
which would be irritating to my eye.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.840
So I'm gonna turn this LED on.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.320
Ah, look at that.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.040
So now the LED is on.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.440
This is Alma Thomas's painting, "Snoopy,"

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.720
lit with just the blue part of the blue-pump phosphor.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.960
The blue light is actually the blue LEDs

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.240
in all of these light bulbs.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.080
I then take this phosphor piece of plastic

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.480
and I hold it closer and closer,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.160
and you can see the phosphor creating white light.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.200
And when it's completely exposed,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.040
I'm now lighting the painting.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.360
Well, with this light bulb.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.200
It's much more effective with the exhibit lights above,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.960
but this gives you a sense of how this works.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.040
So it's the difference between blue light

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.000
and down-converting that blue energy

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.800
to a fuller, brighter, whiter light

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.680
that lets you see all the colors.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.360
And if we light it with fuller, brighter, whiter light,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.360
you'll get the full range of colors.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.800
And it took a while for LEDs

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.640
to be able to create the full spectrum

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.160
so our eyes could see all the colors

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.280
that Alma Thomas is offering us in this painting.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.440
(door clicking)

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.360
Welcome to my shop.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.080
This is my laboratory.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.080
Here, I'm gonna actually put on my safety goggles.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.160
Okay, now what I've got here is a spectrometer,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.560
and I'm gonna measure the spectra

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.400
of the blue part of this LED.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.520
And there we go.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.320
And if you take a look at the readout,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.440
you'll see the blue spectral signature

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.760
peeking at 450 nanometers.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.520
(bulb zapping)

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.200
So same bulb with the yellow shield put back in place.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.120
So we're gonna measure it once the phosphor is in place.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.440
(spectrometer beeping)

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.440
And there it is.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.160
And now, so that blue peak that was so high,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.280
if you actually look at the numbers,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.760
the numbers should be, well, it's gonna be lower

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.800
'cause that blue has been made dimmer

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800
'cause we're down-converting a lot of that blue energy

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.560
into white light.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.160
And literally, blue and yellow make white.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.320
(upbeat music)
