00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Hi, we're in the Smithsonian

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.040
American Art Museum's 19th century galleries.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.000
My name is Scott.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.920
I'm the lighting designer of this museum.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.600
My job is literally to make these artworks

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.360
look as good as they can.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.440
Is light visible?

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.280
It seems obvious.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.600
Yes, light is visible.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.280
But I can create the conditions as a lighting designer

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.080
so light appears invisible.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.200
For example, right in front of me,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.200
there's a giant bright beam of light.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.440
And you wouldn't know it until I put my hands in front of it

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.520
or my face in front of it, and then it becomes apparent.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.000
And that's so much of what my job is,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.440
is to literally put the light where I want it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.120
and take it away where we don't.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.800
And that's what I'm expert in.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.280
Well, I'm gonna press this button

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.920
and I'm going to transition this hallway

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.720
from kind of bright lighting to show you the magic that I do

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.120
when I take each individual spotlight

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.400
and I aim it very carefully at the artworks,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.600
and it looks like this.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.080
So, let's see, 1, 2, 3.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.720
Do you see that?

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.400
That the artworks start coming up brighter and brighter.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.680
And literally, the painting starts coming forwards.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.120
You might be able to actually see the rainbow come out

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.080
in the the Niagara Falls,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.480
and it's really much more dramatic.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.200
This is the Alma Thomas Gallery

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.120
and one of my favorite paintings we have.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.880
This is Alma Thomas' "Snoopy."

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.800
She actually named it after the cartoon,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.440
but even more, the Lunar 10 Module was nicknamed "Snoopy,"

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.080
the module that would actually snoop around the Moon,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.840
looking for the perfect place to land.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.320
What is it about the light

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.840
that allows us to see this full range of color?

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.920
On this artwork, there's about three or four lights.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.080
They're all basically the same kind of light.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.560
It's what I call a blue-pump phosphor LED.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.600
You go to a hardware store or your grocery store,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.920
almost every single light bulb in there that isn't colored

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.080
that's putting out what you think of as white light

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.440
is a blue-pump phosphor LED.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.480
Blue-pump phosphor.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.320
What does that mean?

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.320
That means that the LEDs that inside are actually blue.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.000
And then we take this yellow phosphor,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.440
we lay it on top of the blue and it explodes in white light.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.680
And it's exactly the same kind that we are using here.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.800
So we smashed a few light bulbs.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.240
Let me show you this one.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.760
So when we smashed this light bulb,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.840
it ended looking up like this.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.640
And you see these LEDs? Actually starts with a blue LED.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.680
The LED itself is blue.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.040
It's kind of unbelievable.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.080
And then this phosphor coating

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.000
will make it explode in white light.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.960
Don't take my word for it.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960
Let me show you.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.080
But first, I need to put on these goggles

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.400
because I'm gonna turn on some blue light,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.920
which would be irritating to my eye.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.640
So I'm gonna turn this LED on.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.120
Ah, look at that.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.840
So now the LED is on.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.240
This is Alma Thomas's painting, "Snoopy,"

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.520
lit with just the blue part of the blue-pump phosphor.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.760
The blue light is actually the blue LEDs

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.040
in all of these light bulbs.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.880
I then take this phosphor piece of plastic

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.280
and I hold it closer and closer,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.960
and you can see the phosphor creating white light.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.000
And when it's completely exposed,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.840
I'm now lighting the painting.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.160
Well, with this light bulb.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.000
It's much more effective with the exhibit lights above,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.760
but this gives you a sense of how this works.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.840
So it's the difference between blue light

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.800
and down-converting that blue energy

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.600
to a fuller, brighter, whiter light

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.480
that lets you see all the colors.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.160
And if we light it with fuller, brighter, whiter light,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.160
you'll get the full range of colors.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.600
And it took a while for LEDs

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.440
to be able to create the full spectrum

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.960
so our eyes could see all the colors

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.080
that Alma Thomas is offering us in this painting.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.240
(door clicking)

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.160
Welcome to my shop.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.880
This is my laboratory.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.880
Here, I'm gonna actually put on my safety goggles.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.960
Okay, now what I've got here is a spectrometer,

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.360
and I'm gonna measure the spectra

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.200
of the blue part of this LED.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.320
And there we go.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.120
And if you take a look at the readout,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.240
you'll see the blue spectral signature

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.560
peeking at 450 nanometers.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.320
(bulb zapping)

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.000
So same bulb with the yellow shield put back in place.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.920
So we're gonna measure it once the phosphor is in place.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.240
(spectrometer beeping)

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240
And there it is.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.960
And now, so that blue peak that was so high,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.080
if you actually look at the numbers,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.560
the numbers should be, well, it's gonna be lower

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.600
'cause that blue has been made dimmer

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.600
'cause we're down-converting a lot of that blue energy

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.360
into white light.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.960
And literally, blue and yellow make white.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.120
(upbeat music)
