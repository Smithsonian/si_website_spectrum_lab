00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.560
<v ->Hi, we're in the Smithsonian</v>

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.230
American Art Museum's 19th century galleries.

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.190
My name is Scott.

4
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.110
I'm the lighting designer of this museum.

5
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.810
My job is literally to make these artworks

6
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.550
look as good as they can.

7
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.660
Is light visible?

8
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.493
It seems obvious.

9
00:00:13.493 --> 00:00:14.820
Yes, light is visible.

10
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.490
But I can create the conditions as a lighting designer

11
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.290
so light appears invisible.

12
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.420
For example, right in front of me,

13
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.400
there's a giant bright beam of light.

14
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.640
And you wouldn't know it until I put my hands in front of it

15
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.703
or my face in front of it, and then it becomes apparent.

16
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.210
And that's so much of what my job is,

17
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.640
is to literally put the light where I want it

18
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.320
and take it away where we don't.

19
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.000
And that's what I'm expert in.

20
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.500
Well, I'm gonna press this button

21
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.140
and I'm going to transition this hallway

22
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.920
from kind of bright lighting to show you the magic that I do

23
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.320
when I take each individual spotlight

24
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.620
and I aim it very carefully at the artworks,

25
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.793
and it looks like this.

26
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.263
So, let's see, 1, 2, 3.

27
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.930
Do you see that?

28
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.620
That the artworks start coming up brighter and brighter.

29
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.890
And literally, the painting starts coming forwards.

30
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.320
You might be able to actually see the rainbow come out

31
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.270
in the the Niagara Falls,

32
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.673
and it's really much more dramatic.

33
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.390
This is the Alma Thomas Gallery

34
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.340
and one of my favorite paintings we have.

35
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.100
This is Alma Thomas' "Snoopy."

36
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.010
She actually named it after the cartoon,

37
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.630
but even more, the Lunar 10 Module was nicknamed "Snoopy,"

38
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.300
the module that would actually snoop around the Moon,

39
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.060
looking for the perfect place to land.

40
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.650
And she has another title, "Earth-Sun Display on Earth,"

41
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.090
because this was the first time in 1968

42
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.440
that there was a photograph

43
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.160
of how the Sun illuminates the Earth

44
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.100
from the Moon's point of view.

45
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.600
This is her representation of that first Earthrise image,

46
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.110
where we see the glorious blue marble that we have,

47
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.560
with verdant greens and a whole rainbow of color.

48
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.780
And once you hear Alma Thomas's story

49
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.930
about how she was inspired by the space missions,

50
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.790
it really brings it to life.

51
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.260
What is it about the light

52
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.765
that allows us to see this full range of color?

53
00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:22.830
On this artwork, there's about three or four lights.

54
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.020
They're all basically the same kind of light.

55
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.470
It's what I call a blue-pump phosphor LED.

56
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.530
You go to a hardware store or your grocery store,

57
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.860
almost every single light bulb in there that isn't colored

58
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.990
that's putting out what you think of as white light

59
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.363
is a blue-pump phosphor LED.

60
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.390
Blue-pump phosphor.

61
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.260
What does that mean?

62
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.260
That means that the LEDs that inside are actually blue.

63
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.910
And then we take this yellow phosphor,

64
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.350
we lay it on top of the blue and it explodes in white light.

65
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.593
And it's exactly the same kind that we are using here.

66
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.720
So we smashed a few light bulbs.

67
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.160
Let me show you this one.

68
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.700
So when we smashed this light bulb,

69
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.760
it ended looking up like this.

70
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.560
And you see these LEDs actually starts with a blue LED.

71
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.600
The LED itself is blue.

72
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.950
It's kind of unbelievable.

73
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.020
And then this phosphor coating

74
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.910
will make it explode in white light.

75
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.900
Don't take my word for it.

76
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.890
Let me show you.

77
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.020
But first, I need to put on these goggles

78
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.330
because I'm gonna turn on some blue light,

79
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.860
which would be irritating to my eye.

80
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.570
So I'm gonna turn this LED on.

81
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.040
Ah, look at that.

82
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.750
So now the LED is on.

83
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.170
This is Alma Thomas's painting, "Snoopy,"

84
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.460
lit with just the blue part of the blue-pump phosphor.

85
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.700
The blue light is actually the blue LEDs

86
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.980
in all of these light bulbs.

87
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.800
I then take this phosphor piece of plastic

88
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.210
and I hold it closer and closer,

89
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.897
and you can see the phosphor creating white light.

90
00:03:54.897 --> 00:03:56.910
And when it's completely exposed,

91
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.760
I'm now lighting the painting.

92
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.080
Well, with this light bulb.

93
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.930
It's much more effective with the exhibit lights above,

94
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.670
but this gives you a sense of how this works.

95
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.770
So it's the difference between blue light

96
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.710
and down-converting that blue energy

97
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.520
to a fuller, brighter, whiter light

98
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.410
that lets you see all the colors.

99
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.073
And if we light it with fuller, brighter, whiter light,

100
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.070
you'll get the full range of colors.

101
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.530
And it took a while for LEDs

102
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.360
to be able to create the full spectrum

103
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.900
so our eyes could see all the colors

104
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.014
that Alma Thomas is offering us in this painting.

105
00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:42.180
(door clicking)

106
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.080
Welcome to my shop.

107
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.820
This is my laboratory.

108
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.820
Here, I'm gonna actually put on my safety goggles.

109
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.870
Okay, now what I've got here is a spectrometer,

110
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.270
and I'm gonna measure the spectra

111
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.133
of the blue part of this LED.

112
00:04:57.072 --> 00:04:58.230
And there we go.

113
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.030
And if you take a look at the readout,

114
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.160
you'll see the blue spectral signature

115
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.463
peeking at 450 nanometers.

116
00:05:04.463 --> 00:05:06.240
(bulb zapping)

117
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.930
So same bulb with the yellow shield put back in place.

118
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.855
So we're gonna measure it once the phosphor is in place.

119
00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:14.160
(spectrometer beeping)

120
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.180
And there it is.

121
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.870
And now, so that blue peak that was so high,

122
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.010
if you actually look at the numbers,

123
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.500
the numbers should be, well, it's gonna be lower

124
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.510
'cause that blue has been made dimmer

125
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.540
'cause we're down-converting a lot of that blue energy

126
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.280
into white light.

127
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.883
And literally, blue and yellow make white.

128
00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:37.035
(upbeat music)
