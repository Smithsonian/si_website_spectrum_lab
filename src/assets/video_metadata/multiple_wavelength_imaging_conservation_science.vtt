At the Smithsonian's

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.720
Museum Conservation Institute,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.760
imaging scientist, Keats Webb,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.400
identifies pigments by capturing

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.160
how objects respond to light of different wavelengths.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.920
So one of the benefits of imaging

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.680
is that it's a non-invasive technique

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.840
and it's giving you a full view of the object.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.520
So it doesn't require sampling.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.600
It's not destructive.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.280
Having information about what pigments are in an object

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.360
can help provide information

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.320
about when and where that object might have been made.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.160
Dr. Webb captures a test chart

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.840
of known pigments.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.040
Pigments that look almost the same to us in visible light,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.040
appear very different when they're imaged

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.800
in other wavelengths such as infrared or ultraviolet light.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.960
At the Smithsonian National Museum of Asian Art,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.440
Conservation Scientist Matthew Clarke identifies pigments

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.800
using a different technique, hyperspectral imaging.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.680
One of the tools that we use here

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.600
is a hyperspectral imaging camera

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.040
that's gonna split up light into the different wavelengths

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.240
and measure that on the camera sensor.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.760
So this particular camera

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.560
is going to capture a line of light

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.560
and it's gonna spread that line of light

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.720
across the chip of the camera.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.840
So we're going to have a spectrum

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.960
from each section of that line.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.120
The camera then is going to move along the surface,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.880
and we'll keep collecting those lines

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.080
that then can all be assembled into a cube of data later

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.480
that we can examine and interpret

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.720
and use different specialized software

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.480
to interpret the data.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.840
Now you too can analyze historic artworks

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.640
from our collection using advanced spectral imaging.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.720
