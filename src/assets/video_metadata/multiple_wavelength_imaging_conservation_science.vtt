Museum Conservation Institute,

3
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.580
imaging scientist, Keats Webb,

4
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.220
identifies pigments by capturing

5
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.980
how objects respond to light of different wavelengths.

6
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.720
<v ->So one of the benefits of imaging</v>

7
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.490
is that it's a non-invasive technique

8
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.650
and it's giving you a full view of the object.

9
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.330
So it doesn't require sampling.

10
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.400
It's not destructive.

11
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.090
Having information about what pigments are in an object

12
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.160
can help provide information

13
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.130
about when and where that object might have been made.

14
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Narrator>Dr. Webb captures a test chart</v>

15
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.640
of known pigments.

16
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.850
Pigments that look almost the same to us in visible light,

17
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.860
appear very different when they're imaged

18
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.613
in other wavelengths such as infrared or ultraviolet light.

19
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.780
At the Smithsonian National Museum of Asian Art,

20
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.230
Conservation Scientist Matthew Clarke identifies pigments

21
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.620
using a different technique, hyperspectral imaging.

22
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.480
<v ->One of the tools that we use here</v>

23
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.410
is a hyperspectral imaging camera

24
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.850
that's gonna split up light into the different wavelengths

25
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.060
and measure that on the camera sensor.

26
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.560
So this particular camera

27
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.350
is going to capture a line of light

28
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.360
and it's gonna spread that line of light

29
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.510
across the chip of the camera.

30
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.640
So we're going to have a spectrum

31
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.770
from each section of that line.

32
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.920
The camera then is going to move along the surface,

33
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.670
and we'll keep collecting those lines

34
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.880
that then can all be assembled into a cube of data later

35
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.280
that we can examine and interpret

36
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.505
and use different specialized software

37
00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:37.290
to interpret the data.

38
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.660
Now you too can analyze historic artworks

39
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.438
from our collection using advanced spectral imaging.

40
00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:45.521
