00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.040
Right now we're taking images of a pigment chart,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.640
and this was made by an MCI staff member

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.280
and an intern several years ago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.400
and this is a good reference for different techniques

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.800
to test and see how the different pigments respond

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.840
to different wavelengths.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.520
White at the top,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.200
we have zinc white, titanium white,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.840
and a lead white.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.480
They look the same in visible light,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.960
but they respond a little bit differently

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.600
to other wavelengths.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.640
Ultraviolet wavelengths cannot be seen

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.240
directly with our eyes.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.000
To take an image in UV,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.080
Dr. Webb puts a special filter,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.720
one that blocks visible light,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.160
in front of the lens.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.920
Then, using only an ultraviolet light source,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.160
she captures the image.
(camera shutter clicks)

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.840
Pigments can differ dramatically

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.000
in how much UV light is reflected or absorbed.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.160
And this is showing us a difference

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.520
in how those materials are absorbing,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.640
reflecting, and transmitting the UV radiation.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.040
So we were seeing in that top left,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.280
we have the strongest absorption

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.640
with that zinc white.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.920
Lead white is absorbing quite a bit down here,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.720
so that's that medium gray,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.080
but we're seeing a little bit more kind of reflection

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.360
or transmission with this middle white.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.200
We're also seeing some differences with the blues,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.840
with this cobalt blue reflecting quite a bit

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.280
of UV radiation,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.840
but we're seeing some absorption with the indigo,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.800
the Prussian, and the other blues in this top area.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.000
Some materials absorb UV

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.080
and re-emit some of this energy as visible light.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.840
This is called UV-induced visible luminescence,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.720
an additional clue for identifying pigments.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.880
So on the computer screen,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.440
we're seeing the images,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.040
the UV-induced visible luminescence images.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.240
We can see those differences

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.920
in how the whites are responding.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.360
So these are the different whites

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.680
that are up in the top left.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.400
We have one that's luminescing this yellow color,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.240
we have one that's kind of a bluish color,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.720
and then we have one that's absorbing,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.960
that's not luminescing.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.160
And if we think back to that visible light image

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.120
or looking at it

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.240
under kind of the standard room lights,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.160
those all looked the same.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.760
(upbeat music)
