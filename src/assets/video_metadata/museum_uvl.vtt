00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.030
<v ->Right now we're taking images of a pigment chart,</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.640
and this was made by an MCI staff member

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.290
and an intern several years ago,

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.390
and this is a good reference for different techniques

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.820
to test and see how the different pigments respond

6
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.860
to different wavelengths.

7
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.540
White at the top,

8
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.210
we have zinc white, titanium white,

9
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.860
and a lead white.

10
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.480
They look the same in visible light,

11
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.950
but they respond a little bit differently

12
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.590
to other wavelengths.

13
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Narrator>Ultraviolet wavelengths cannot be seen</v>

14
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.250
directly with our eyes.

15
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.020
To take an image in UV,

16
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.090
Dr. Webb puts a special filter,

17
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.710
one that blocks visible light,

18
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.150
in front of the lens.

19
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.910
Then, using only an ultraviolet light source,

20
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.180
she captures the image.
(camera shutter clicks)

21
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.860
Pigments can differ dramatically

22
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.010
in how much UV light is reflected or absorbed.

23
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.170
<v ->And this is showing us a difference</v>

24
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.540
in how those materials are absorbing,

25
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.660
reflecting, and transmitting the UV radiation.

26
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.030
So we were seeing in that top left,

27
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.280
we have the strongest absorption

28
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.630
with that zinc white.

29
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.910
Lead white is absorbing quite a bit down here,

30
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.710
so that's that medium gray,

31
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.080
but we're seeing a little bit more kind of reflection

32
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.350
or transmission with this middle white.

33
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.220
We're also seeing some differences with the blues,

34
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.850
with this cobalt blue reflecting quite a bit

35
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.290
of UV radiation,

36
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.840
but we're seeing some absorption with the indigo,

37
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.820
the Prussian, and the other blues in this top area.

38
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Narrator>Some materials absorb UV</v>

39
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.070
and re-emit some of this energy as visible light.

40
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.850
This is called UV-induced visible luminescence,

41
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.730
an additional clue for identifying pigments.

42
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.900
<v ->So on the computer screen,</v>

43
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.460
we're seeing the images,

44
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.040
the UV-induced visible luminescence images.

45
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.260
We can see those differences

46
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.940
in how the whites are responding.

47
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.380
So these are the different whites

48
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.670
that are up in the top left.

49
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.400
We have one that's luminescing this yellow color,

50
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.230
we have one that's kind of a bluish color,

51
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.730
and then we have one that's absorbing,

52
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.960
that's not luminescing.

53
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.150
And if we think back to that visible light image

54
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.140
or looking at it

55
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.260
under kind of the standard room lights,

56
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.161
those all looked the same.

57
00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:08.744
(bright music)
