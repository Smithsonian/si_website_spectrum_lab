00:00.000 --> 00:01.390
If you look at the solar system,

00:01.390 --> 00:02.980
we basically have eight planets

00:02.980 --> 00:05.140
that everybody knows their names.

00:05.140 --> 00:08.020
And as you look at other stars around the Sun,

00:08.020 --> 00:10.840
it turns out that pretty much every star has a planet,

00:10.840 --> 00:13.300
so we call those planets exoplanets,

00:13.300 --> 00:15.820
planets outside the solar system.

00:15.820 --> 00:18.880
The most successful way to discover exoplanets

00:18.880 --> 00:21.520
is the transit method in which planets

00:21.520 --> 00:24.220
go in front of the star and the light

00:24.220 --> 00:28.180
coming from the star drops by about 1%

00:28.180 --> 00:31.000
and that's how you know that there's a planet there.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.140
The transiting method is a very powerful method

00:35.140 --> 00:39.160
because if we can get enough precision in the measurement

00:39.160 --> 00:43.397
of that transit, you can actually answer questions like,

00:43.397 --> 00:46.060
"What are these planets made of?"

00:46.060 --> 00:49.420
And the way we do this is the light

00:49.420 --> 00:51.850
that we collect from that star

00:51.850 --> 00:54.550
while the planet is going in front of it,

00:54.550 --> 00:57.520
we use things like prisms

00:57.520 --> 01:00.730
and we split that light into different colors.

01:00.730 --> 01:05.650
So by looking at how the depth of the transit changes

01:05.650 --> 01:08.590
as a function of color, we can detect the number

01:08.590 --> 01:11.170
of chemical elements and molecules in the atmosphere

01:11.170 --> 01:14.050
of the planet, such as sodium, potassium,

01:14.050 --> 01:16.870
water, and other molecules.

01:16.870 --> 01:21.130
Hot Jupiters are these very peculiar type of planet,

01:21.130 --> 01:24.640
which is they are about the same size of our own Jupiter,

01:24.640 --> 01:25.780
sometimes a little bit bigger,

01:25.780 --> 01:28.900
sometimes a little bit smaller, but around that size,

01:28.900 --> 01:30.730
but the cool thing about these systems

01:30.730 --> 01:35.470
is that they orbit very, very close to their host star.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.640
Like a typical hot Jupiter

01:36.640 --> 01:39.520
goes around once every three days.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.740
There's nothing like this in the solar system.

01:41.740 --> 01:43.540
This is new science.

01:43.540 --> 01:45.850
The second good thing about hot Jupiters

01:45.850 --> 01:49.480
is that they're very easy to observe.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.220
And I say that they're very easy now.

01:51.220 --> 01:54.040
30 years ago it was difficult, but now it's easy,

01:54.040 --> 01:56.830
so we can get very, very large signals

01:56.830 --> 01:59.470
and we can measure very, very precisely

01:59.470 --> 02:02.830
the properties of these planets.

02:02.830 --> 02:07.210
With this technique, we can observe molecules such as water

02:07.210 --> 02:10.570
and elements such as potassium and sodium.

02:10.570 --> 02:12.910
So why sodium and potassium?

02:12.910 --> 02:16.570
You can learn a lot about how that planet was born

02:16.570 --> 02:18.520
and how it became a hot Jupiter.

02:18.520 --> 02:23.520
That planet most likely started farther out in that system

02:23.560 --> 02:26.260
and somehow it migrated in,

02:26.260 --> 02:30.190
and as it migrated in, was collecting sodium and potassium

02:30.190 --> 02:34.243
from dust grains on the disc where the planet formed.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.750
With the launch of the James Webb Telescope,

02:37.750 --> 02:40.840
we are now witnessing a revolution in this field.

02:40.840 --> 02:44.500
Some of these molecules that we can now observe

02:44.500 --> 02:49.500
in the right environment could be signs of life

02:49.500 --> 02:51.665
producing those molecules in this planet.

02:51.665 --> 02:55.210
This is what we call biosignatures or biomarkers.

02:55.210 --> 02:57.250
For example, if you look at Earth,

02:57.250 --> 03:00.340
we know that there are certain molecules on Earth

03:00.340 --> 03:02.020
that are produced by life.

03:02.020 --> 03:03.550
We know that there is oxygen,

03:03.550 --> 03:05.290
we know that there is methane,

03:05.290 --> 03:07.570
and those molecules would not be stable

03:07.570 --> 03:10.480
in Earth's atmosphere if there wasn't some kind

03:10.480 --> 03:13.090
of organism producing them.

03:13.090 --> 03:14.470
And in addition to that,

03:14.470 --> 03:17.680
we will have to look at other properties of the planet.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.230
We will have to look at whether the planet

03:20.230 --> 03:22.780
is rocky or not, i.e., the density.

03:22.780 --> 03:25.870
We will have to look at the temperature of the planet.

03:25.870 --> 03:28.990
We will have to look at the ultraviolet radiation

03:28.990 --> 03:32.710
coming from the star to see if life can survive,

03:32.710 --> 03:35.350
so once we put all these pieces together,

03:35.350 --> 03:38.440
I do believe that we will find life somewhere.

03:38.440 --> 03:41.340
It's not gonna be easy, but I do believe that we'll do it.

03:43.180 --> 03:46.570
So now it's your turn to apply what you have learned

03:46.570 --> 03:50.860
about a spectroscopy to exoplanet atmospheric spectra

03:50.860 --> 03:54.070
and propose what molecule or molecules

03:54.070 --> 03:57.366
you want to search for in real JWST data.

03:57.366 --> 03:59.949
(upbeat music)
