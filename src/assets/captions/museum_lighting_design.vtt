00:00:06.458 --> 00:00:09.000
Hi, we're in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.458
19th century galleries. My name is Scott.

00:00:11.458 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm the lighting designer of this museum.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.333
My job is literally to make these

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.708
artworks look as good as they can.

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:19.708
Is light visible? It seems obvious ---

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:21.833
Yes, light is visible, but I can create

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:24.000
the conditions as a lighting designer

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so light appears invisible.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.291
For example, right in front of me, there's a giant

00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.125
bright beam of light, and you wouldn't know it

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.791
until I put my hands in front of it

00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:34.375
or my face in front of it,

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:36.000
and then it becomes apparent.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.500
And that's so much of what my job is,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.833
is to literally put

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:42.000
the light where I want it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and take it away where we don't.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And that's what I'm expert in.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.500
Well, I'm going to press this button,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.000
and I'm going to transition

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
this hallway from kind of bright lighting to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.208
show you the magic that I do when I

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:55.416
take each individual spotlight,

00:00:55.416 --> 00:00:57.708
and I aim it very carefully at the artworks,

00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:00.000
and it looks like this.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So let's see: one, two, three...

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.583
Do you see that, that the artworks start

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:14.000
coming up brighter and brighter?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And literally, the painting starts coming forwards.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.500
You might be able to actually see

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.000
the rainbow come out in the Niagara Falls,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and it's really much more dramatic.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.500
This is the Alma Thomas Gallery,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.250
and one of my favorite paintings we have.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.000
This is Alma Thomas's "Snoopy."

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.083
She actually named it after the cartoon,

00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:36.000
but even more,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the Lunar 10 Module was nicknamed "Snoopy,"

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.958
the module that would actually snoop around

00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:45.000
the Moon looking for the perfect place to land

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.041
And she has another title,

00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:49.083
"Earth Sun Display on Earth"

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:52.000
because this was the first time,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.416
in 1968, that there was a photograph

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:59.375
of how the Sun illuminates the Earth

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:02.000
from the Moon's point of view.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is her representation of that first

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Earthrise image, where we see

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the glorious blue marble that we have

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
with verdant greens and a whole rainbow of color.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And once you hear Alma Thomas's story

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
about how she was inspired

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
by the space missions, it really brings it to life.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.500
What is it about the light that allows

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.000
us to see this full range of color?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
On this artwork, there is about three or four lights.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They're all basically the same kind of light.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's what I call a "blue pump phosphor LED".

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If you go to a hardware store or your grocery store

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
almost every single light bulb in there ---

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.500
that isn't colored, that's putting out

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.000
what you think of as white light ---

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
is a blue pump phosphor LED.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.541
Blue pump phosphor.

00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:49.416
What does that mean?

00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:52.833
That means that the LEDs inside

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.000
are actually blue.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.041
And then we take this yellow phosphor,

00:02:57.041 --> 00:02:59.000
we lay it on top of the blue,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.500
and it explodes in white light.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.250
And it's exactly the same kind

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.125
that we are using here.

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:07.250
So we smashed a few light bulbs.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.000
Let me show you this one.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So when we smashed this light bulb, it ---

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it ended looking up like this.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.375
And you see these LEDs?

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:20.000
It actually starts with a blue LED.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The LED itself is blue.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.208
It's kind of unbelievable.

00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:25.083
And then this phosphor coating

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:27.000
will make it explode in white light.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.166
Don't take take my word for it,

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.000
let me show you, but first I need

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.333
to put on these goggles,

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.333
because I'm going to turn on some blue light,

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:35.000
which would be irritating to my eye.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.000
So I'm going to turn this LED on.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.291
Ah, look at that.

00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:40.000
So now the LED is on.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
This is Alma Thomas's painting Snoopy,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
lit with just the blue part of the blue pump phosphor.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.500
The blue light is actually the blue LEDs

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.000
in all of these light bulbs.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I then take this phosphor piece of plastic

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.541
and I hold it closer and closer,

00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:00.000
and you can see the phosphor creating white

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.333
light, and when it's completely exposed,

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:04.666
I'm now lighting the painting,

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:07.000
well, with this light bulb.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.500
It's much more effective with the exhibit lights above,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.000
but this gives you a sense of how

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
this works.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.583
So it's the difference between blue light

00:04:17.583 --> 00:04:21.291
and down-converting that blue energy to a fuller,

00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:25.541
brighter, whiter light that lets you see all the colors.

00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:30.000
And if we light it with fuller, brighter, whiter light,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
you'll get the full range of colors.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And it took a while for LEDs to be able to

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
create the full spectrum of ---

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.750
the full spectrum,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.000
so our eyes could see all the colors that

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.666
Alma Thomas is offering us in this painting.

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:49.250
Welcome to my shop.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.041
This is my laboratory.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.916
I'm going to actually put on my safety goggles.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.625
Okay.

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:57.000
Now, what I've got here is a spectrometer.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.166
And I'm gonna measure the spectra

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:03.000
of the blue part of this LED.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.291
And there we go.

00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:05.708
And if you take a look at the readout,

00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:07.833
you'll see the blue spectral signature

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:10.000
peaking at 450 nanometers.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So same bulb, with the yellow shield put back in place.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So we're going to measure it once the phosphor is in place.

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:21.166
and there it is.

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:24.000
And now, so that blue peak that was so high,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.958
if you actually look at the numbers,

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.083
the numbers should be,

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:28.416
well, it's going to be lower

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:29.916
because that blue has been

00:05:29.916 --> 00:05:31.416
made dimmer because we're down-converting

00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:33.000
a lot of that blue energy

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
into white light and literally

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
blue and yellow make white.
