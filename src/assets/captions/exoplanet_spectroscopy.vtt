00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.458
If you look at the solar system,

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:11.959
we basically have eight planets that

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.709
you know, everybody knows their names.

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.792
And as you look at other stars around the Sun,

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:19.000
it turns out that pretty much every star has a planet.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.917
So we call the these planets exoplanets:

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.959
planets outside the solar system.

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:27.417
The most successful way to discover exoplanets

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:29.417
is the transit method in which

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:31.542
planets go in front of the star

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:34.250
and the light coming from the star

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.917
drops by about 1%. And that's how

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:38.959
you know that there is a planet there.

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:42.917
The transiting method is a very powerful method,

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:46.875
because if we can get enough precision

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:48.875
in the measurement of that transit,

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:52.000
you can actually answer questions like:

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.875
What are these planets made of?

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:56.917
And the way we do this is

00:00:56.917 --> 00:00:59.917
the light that we collect from that star

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:03.083
while the planet is going in front of it,

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:06.417
we use things like prisms and we split

00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:08.917
that light into different colors.

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:12.875
So by looking at how the depth of the

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.917
transit changes as a function of color

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:17.417
we can detect a number of chemical

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:18.917
elements and molecules

00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:20.917
in the atmosphere of the planet,

00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:22.500
such as sodium, potassium,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.875
water, and other molecules.

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:28.875
Hot Jupiters are this very peculiar type of planet

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.875
which is they are about the same size

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:32.834
of our own Jupiter,

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:33.792
sometimes a little bit bigger,

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.542
sometimes a little bit smaller,

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:36.875
but around that size.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.875
But the cool thing about these systems is that they

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:44.333
orbit very, very close to their host star.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.875
A typical hot Jupiter goes around once every three days.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.875
There's nothing like this in the solar system.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.834
This is new science.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:53.834
The second good thing about

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.875
Hot Jupiters is that they

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:58.208
are very easy to observe.

00:01:58.208 --> 00:01:59.750
And I say that they are very easy now.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.583
30 years ago, it was difficult, but now it's easy.

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:05.834
So we can get very, very large signals and

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.291
we can measure very, very precisely

00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:10.834
the properties of these planets

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:13.834
With this technique, we can observe

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:16.291
molecules such as water,

00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:18.834
and elements such as potassium and sodium.

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:20.291
So why sodium and potassium?

00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:22.834
You can learn a lot about

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:24.792
how that planet was born and

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:26.834
how it became a Hot Jupiter.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:30.834
That planet, most likely, started farther out

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:33.834
in that system, and somehow it migrated in,

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:37.834
and as it migrated in, it was collecting

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:40.291
sodium and potassium from dust grains

00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:42.792
on the disk where the planet formed.

00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:46.291
With the launch of the James Webb Telescope,

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.792
we're now witnessing a revolution in this field.

00:02:48.792 --> 00:02:51.792
Some of these molecules that we can now

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:55.583
observe in the right environment could be

00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:59.792
signs of life producing those molecules in these planets.

00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:01.750
This is what we call

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.792
"bio-signatures" or "bio-markers."

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:06.792
For example, if you look at Earth, we know that

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:08.875
there are certain molecules on Earth

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:10.792
that are produced by life.

00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:12.291
We know that there is oxygen,

00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:13.792
we know that there is methane,

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.458
and those molecules would not be

00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:17.166
stable in Earth's atmosphere

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:19.792
if there wasn't some kind of organism

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:21.375
producing them.

00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:23.750
And in addition to that, we will

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.542
have to look at at other properties of the planet.

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:28.250
We will have to look at whether the planet

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.750
is rocky or not, i.e., the density.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.709
We will have to look at the temperature of the planet.

00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:35.875
We will have to look at

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:38.750
the ultraviolet radiation coming from the star

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.750
to see if life can survive.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.750
So once we put all these pieces together,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.083
I do believe that we will find life somewhere.

00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:48.208
It's not going to be easy,

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:49.709
but I do believe that we will do it.

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:53.750
So now, it's your turn to apply

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.125
what you have learned about spectroscopy

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:59.166
to exoplanet atmospheric spectra

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:02.583
and propose what molecule or molecules

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:05.417
you want to search for in real JWST data.
