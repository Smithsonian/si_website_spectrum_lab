00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.917
Having information about what pigments are in an object

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.917
can help provide information about when and where that object might have been made.

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:20.166
Materials respond differently to different wavelengths,

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:24.375
if they reflect in the infrared, but absorb in the visible,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:27.917
those are going to give us information about what that pigment is.

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:33.959
And so I'm gonna use a filter that

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:38.291
blocks visible light and passes infrared radiation.

00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:40.917
So we can't see through it because we can't see into the infrared.

00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:48.875
We're looking at a reflected infrared image of the pigment charts.

00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:53.875
We're going to see some different responses of those pigments.

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:57.375
Let's take a look at some of those blues.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.875
So this is the infrared image, we're going to switch back to the visible

00:01:01.917 --> 00:01:04.875
We can see some differences in how

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:07.875
the infrared wavelengths are being absorbed and reflected.

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:10.875
So we see here, Prussian blue is absorbing

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:12.875
that infrared radiation.

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:18.500
This is Prussian blue, too, but we have azarite, which is not absorbing quite as much

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.875
Indigo, it's reflecting quite a bit, so we are seeing those differences.

00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:25.875
And you can do some processing to really bring out those

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:29.792
differences, and that's creating a combined image

00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:33.875
of the visible light and the infrared, and it's a false color infrared image.

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:36.875
And that can give us some information about characterizing

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:38.834
and differentiating those pigments.

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:45.834
I'm Matthew Clark, I'm a conservation scientist at the National Museum of Asian Art.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.709
One of the tools that we use here is a

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.834
hyper-spectral imaging camera that's going to split up light

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:56.792
into the different wavelengths and measure that

00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:58.917
on the camera sensor.

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:03.375
This particular camera is going to capture a line of light

00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:08.834
and it's going to spread that line of light across the chip of the camera.

00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:12.750
So we're going to have a spectrum from each section of that line.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.542
The camera then is going to move along the surface, and we'll keep collecting those

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:21.792
lines that then can all be assembled into

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:25.792
a cube of data later that we can examine and interpret,

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:29.792
and use different specialized software to interpret the data.

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:32.834
Right now, we're looking at a scene from the

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:35.792
Japanese hand scrolls about Jizō Bosatsu

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:40.792
And in this scene, we've identified pigments

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:43.792
that are present based off of the spectra that we see.

00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:46.792
And in this interior scene, we can see a

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:50.750
number of ladies in waiting inside on

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:53.750
these tatami mats, which appear as somewhat of green

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.750
and we can see a number of areas of red and some other discoloration.

00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:01.750
This is a set of spectra.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.750
I'm going to focus on this green spectrum, which is a copper green.

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:08.750
And this purple spectrum that we

00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:11.750
can associate as indigo.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:14.750
So we're going to take these different spectra and

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:19.750
process all the spectra within that data cube

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:22.750
to look for when do we see these features.

00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:25.750
So if we were trying to, let's say, look for

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:28.750
this copper green, if we know is

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.709
present based on the appearance and based on other techniques where we know that there's copper

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.709
present, we can---I have to open up another file to highlight this---

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.709
So what we're seeing now is: Everywhere where it is bright,

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.375
the whiter it is,

00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:48.709
the closer a match it is to that copper green spectrum.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.709
So in these areas where we can see these tatami mats,

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.709
we can see a really strong signal from that copper green,

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.000
more so than we might expect

00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:01.709
based on looking at it visibly.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.709
The other case, the indigo that I mentioned, if I was

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.709
glancing at this, I might not say, where is the indigo?

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.709
So that, again, is this purple spectrum.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.667
It has this kind of particular inflection point around 700 nanometers.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.709
And if I load that spectrum, where

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.166
we see these bright white areas is where

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:28.667
this indigo was present.

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:31.667
So in that case, it's really found

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:35.667
at the bottom of the scroll, giving sort of either a watery or

00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:38.667
foggy presence below this interior scene.

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:42.709
And we've actually found that in a lot of different areas of the scroll,

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:45.667
with this indigo. Once we know it's there, you can kind of

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:50.667
just see its presence, but we can also see where it was lost between the fill.

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:56.041
So this is going to be... The contrast is a bit boosted now to look at

00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:59.667
one of the things we'd like to do is to confirm these

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:02.166
areas where we think there is indigo,

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:05.834
based off of the statistical analysis.

00:05:05.834 --> 00:05:08.417
I want to actually confirm by looking at the spectrum there.

00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:12.667
So here, I can pull up the spectrum

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:15.625
and see that kind of distinctive shape of the indigo.

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:17.625
So that lets me know it's there.

00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:19.625
And in areas where, by my eye, it looks like a

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:24.625
very similar faint blue in this area of damage.

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:28.291
The software doesn't see the indigo, and I don't see it there in the spectrum either.

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:31.709
So, we're able to pull out some of this information

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:34.625
that we wouldn't otherwise note.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:37.834
And we can kind of essentially go

00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:41.166
and kind of explore around the scene.

00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:45.625
Here, we're looking at this deep red color, which is the vermilion,

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:48.583
which is a mercury sulfide, and has a very sharp transition.

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:50.583
It's very distinctive.

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:53.583
The palette of this scroll compared to some of

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:58.583
the other things that we look at is much more limited, and that it's supposed to simply be the style.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:04.583
Now, you too, can analyze historic artworks from our collection using advanced spectral imaging.
